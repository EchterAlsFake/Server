# What's this?
Hi, you came across my 24/7 personal server for my projects.
You can access it under:

**https://echteralsfake.duckdns.org/**

> [!NOTE]
> You need an IPv6 address to access the server, it runs IPv6 only. 

### What does it do? 
- Serves as a test for myself
- Update checking for Porn Fetch
- Error / Feedback reporting for Porn Fetch
- Local API Tests for my Porn APIs
- Landing page


### Where and how?
- In my own home 24/7 
- 1gbp/s download, 50mbit/s upload (Ethernet)
- Running on an Acer Swift 3 (4c 8t, 8GB RAM)
- Powered by Arch Linux 


### Data collection?
- No IP
- Strict Zero Log policy
- German / EU privacy protecting you
- No NGINX Remote Address copying
- No debug information

### Why? 
Because I want to have full control all the time about the data being stored,
the device hosting it and I want to learn a little bit by doing it myself.

### What about IPv4
Ask Vodafone to get me an IPv4, then I can enable it ;) 

### Future Plans? 
- [] Own Domain (Namecheap)
- [] A real SSL certificate
- [] More endpoints for more projects
- [] License server for Porn Fetch
- [] Better I/O handling and saving of reports / errors
- [] IPv4 support (I try to ask Vodafone kindly)
- [] Backup using my Tablet in case main server is down (don't know if that works though)
